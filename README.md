* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

### Features
  * On our webage you can click the different buttons to access different features of the site.
  * Show New Random Cover, will generate a new radom image, title, and descriptors.
  * Save Cover, will allow the user to save the current shown cover to view later.
  * View Saved Covers, will show all covers that the user has saved.
  * Make Your Own Cover, this allows users to input their own values that will then be used to generate a custom book cover. Make note that to have an image generate, the user must paste a link to an image in the "Cover" input area.
